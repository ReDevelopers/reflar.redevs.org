      <p>ReFlar is a Flarum 3rd party extension development group that primarily focuses on the Flarum extension ecosystem.</p>
      <p>
        Founded by Charlie (CDK2020) and Christian (Ralkage) in 2017, what started out as a two eager people wanting to bring high quality and highly requested extenions to the Flarum community, ReFlar has been gifted with talented new joiners over the span of a year.
        From polls to gamification, ReFlar knows what forum communities want and need from what is not readily available in the beta stages of Flarum.
